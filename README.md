# 💫 About Me:
With 6+ years of hands-on experience in AWS, ETL engineering, AI, LLM integrations, business automation and business integration, I help teams fix broken pipelines, build end-to-end cloud architectures, and deploy intelligent automation that saves time and reduces operational friction.

I build scalable AWS data platforms and AI-powered automation systems that transform raw, messy data into fast, reliable, and intelligent pipelines ready for analytics and production workloads.

I build reliable business automation using APIs, Zapier, n8n, and custom middleware. I deliver End-to-end business automation, API-first integrations, and production-grade AI systems across AWS, Zapier, n8n, and custom Node/PHP service.
